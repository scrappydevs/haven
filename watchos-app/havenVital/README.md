# Haven Watch App - Setup Guide

## ✅ Files Created

All necessary Swift files have been created:

```
havenVital Watch App/
├── ContentView.swift (✅ Updated)
├── Models/
│   ├── Vitals.swift (✅ Created)
│   └── DeviceInfo.swift (✅ Created)
├── Services/
│   ├── HealthKitManager.swift (✅ Created)
│   ├── WebSocketService.swift (✅ Created)
│   └── PairingService.swift (✅ Created)
└── Views/
    ├── PairingView.swift (✅ Created)
    └── VitalBadge.swift (✅ Created)
```

## 🔧 Required Configuration

### 1. Add Files to Xcode Project

Open `havenVital.xcodeproj` in Xcode, then:

1. **Right-click** on `havenVital Watch App` folder
2. Click **Add Files to "havenVital"...**
3. Navigate to the `Models` folder and select both files
4. Ensure **"Copy items if needed"** is UNCHECKED
5. Ensure **Target** is set to "havenVital Watch App"
6. Click **Add**
7. Repeat for `Services` and `Views` folders

**OR** Simply drag and drop the folders from Finder into Xcode.

### 2. Enable HealthKit Capability

1. Select your **watch app target** in Xcode
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities**
3. Click **+ Capability**
4. Search for and add **HealthKit**

### 3. Configure Info.plist

Add these keys to `havenVital Watch App/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>Haven needs access to your health data to monitor your vitals for clinical care.</string>

<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>Haven may write health data for record keeping.</string>
```

**To add in Xcode:**
1. Open `Info.plist`
2. Right-click → **Add Row**
3. Add `Privacy - Health Share Usage Description` → Set value to message above
4. Add `Privacy - Health Update Usage Description` → Set value to message above

### 4. Update API URLs

Update the backend URL in these files:

**PairingService.swift (line 5):**
```swift
static let baseURL = "https://api-haven.onrender.com"  // Change to your backend URL
```

**WebSocketService.swift (line 9):**
```swift
private let baseURL = "wss://api-haven.onrender.com/ws/wearable"  // Change to your backend URL
```

**For local development:**
- Use `http://localhost:8000` for REST API
- Use `ws://localhost:8000/ws/wearable` for WebSocket

**For production:**
- Use `https://your-backend.com` for REST API
- Use `wss://your-backend.com/ws/wearable` for WebSocket (note: wss not ws)

## 🏗️ Build & Run

### Build on Simulator

1. Select **havenVital Watch App** scheme
2. Select **Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm)** simulator
3. Press **Cmd+R**

### Build on Physical Watch

1. Connect iPhone to Mac via USB
2. Ensure Apple Watch is paired with iPhone
3. Unlock Apple Watch
4. Select **havenVital Watch App** scheme
5. Select your **Apple Watch** from device list
6. Press **Cmd+R**

**Note:** First build may take a few minutes to install on physical watch.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Initial Setup
- [ ] App launches on watch
- [ ] Pairing view displays
- [ ] Can enter 6-digit code using watch keyboard
- [ ] HealthKit permission prompt appears

### Pairing Flow
- [ ] Generate pairing code on dashboard
- [ ] Enter code on watch
- [ ] Watch displays "Connected" status
- [ ] Dashboard shows "Paired successfully"

### Vitals Collection
- [ ] Heart rate displays (may need to start a workout to activate sensor)
- [ ] Heart rate updates in real-time
- [ ] HRV value appears (may take 5+ minutes)
- [ ] SpO2 value appears (if watch supports it - Series 6+)
- [ ] Battery level displays correctly

### WebSocket Connection
- [ ] Green dot shows "Connected" status
- [ ] Dashboard receives vitals data
- [ ] Vitals update every 10 seconds
- [ ] Connection persists when watch sleeps
- [ ] Reconnects after network interruption

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "HealthKit not available"
- Simulator: Some HealthKit features limited on simulator
- Physical watch: Ensure watchOS 9.0+ installed
- Check Info.plist has correct permissions

### "No heart rate data"
- Start a **Workout** on watch to activate HR sensor
- Wait 30-60 seconds for first reading
- Ensure watch is worn snugly on wrist

### "WebSocket connection failed"
- Check backend is running and accessible
- Verify URL format: `wss://` for HTTPS, `ws://` for HTTP
- Check firewall/network restrictions
- Verify device_id was returned from pairing

### "Pairing code invalid"
- Code expires after 5 minutes
- Ensure code entered exactly as displayed
- Generate new code if expired

### "App crashes on launch"
- Ensure all files added to Xcode project
- Check HealthKit capability is enabled
- Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K) and rebuild

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### First Launch
1. App shows pairing view
2. Enter 6-digit code from dashboard
3. HealthKit permission request appears
4. After granting, monitoring dashboard appears

### During Monitoring
- **Heart Rate**: Updates every 5-10 seconds
- **HRV**: Updates every 5 minutes
- **SpO2**: Updates every 2 minutes (if available)
- **Respiratory Rate**: Updates every 5 minutes
- **Vitals sent to backend**: Every 10 seconds

### Battery Impact
- Expected: 5-10% battery drain per hour
- Optimize by reducing update frequency if needed
- WebSocket pings every 30 seconds to maintain connection

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once the watch app is working:

1. **Test end-to-end flow**: Pair watch → Verify vitals on dashboard
2. **Check database**: Verify vitals stored in `wearable_vitals` table
3. **Monitor logs**: Check backend logs for WebSocket messages
4. **Test disconnection**: Put watch in airplane mode, verify reconnects

## 📝 Development Notes

- **API calls are async**: Use `await` for all network calls
- **HealthKit queries**: Return nil if no data available
- **WebSocket lifecycle**: Auto-reconnects if connection drops
- **Battery monitoring**: WKInterfaceDevice.batteryLevel (0.0-1.0)
- **Persistence**: deviceId and patientId stored in UserDefaults

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- [ ] All WebSocket traffic uses WSS (TLS encryption) in production
- [ ] API endpoints validate pairing codes
- [ ] HealthKit data never leaves device except via Haven backend
- [ ] Device ID stored securely in UserDefaults
- [ ] No sensitive patient data stored on watch
