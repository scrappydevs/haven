# Patient Search Fix - Debug Summary

## Problem Identified

When typing in patient names in the PatientSearchModal, no patients were showing up despite having patients in Supabase.

### Root Cause
The backend `/patients/search` endpoint was filtering patients by `enrollment_status = 'active'`, but the patients in your Supabase database likely don't have this field properly set.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Search Endpoint (✅ Fixed)
**File:** `backend/app/main.py`

Modified the `/patients/search` endpoint to:
- Remove the strict `enrollment_status = 'active'` database filter
- Apply a flexible filter after fetching that accepts patients with:
  - `enrollment_status = 'active'`
  - `enrollment_status = null` (missing field)
  - No `enrollment_status` field at all

This makes the search work immediately without requiring database changes.

### 2. Fix Script Created (🆕)
**File:** `backend/scripts/fix_enrollment_status.py`

Created a utility script to update all existing patients in Supabase to have `enrollment_status = 'active'`.

**Run this to permanently fix the database:**
```bash
cd backend
python scripts/fix_enrollment_status.py
```

### 3. Patient Generator Updated (✅ Fixed)
**File:** `backend/scripts/generate_patients.py`

Updated to include `enrollment_status: 'active'` for all future patient generation, ensuring consistency with the database schema.

## How to Test

### Immediate Test (Backend Changes Only)
1. **Restart your backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m app.main
   # or
   ./start_backend.sh
   ```

2. **Test the search endpoint directly:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/patients/search?q="
   ```
   You should now see patients returned.

3. **Test in the UI:**
   - Go to the Stream page
   - Click "Select Patient" 
   - The modal should open
   - Type any patient name
   - Patients should now appear in the search results

### Permanent Fix (Update Database)
Run the fix script to set `enrollment_status = 'active'` for all patients:

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/fix_enrollment_status.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Check current enrollment_status for all patients
- ✅ Update missing/incorrect values to 'active'
- ✅ Verify the changes

## Database Schema Reference

According to `DATABASE_REFERENCE.md`, the `patients` table should have:

```
enrollment_status (text) - Status: 'active', 'completed', 'withdrawn'
```

Valid values:
- `'active'` - Currently enrolled in trial
- `'completed'` - Finished trial participation
- `'withdrawn'` - Withdrawn from trial

## Verification Steps

1. **Check backend logs** when searching:
   ```
   🔍 Searching patients with query: 'John'
   ✅ Found X patients
   📊 After enrollment_status filter: X patients
   ```

2. **Check browser console** (F12) when using PatientSearchModal:
   ```
   📦 Received data: [...]
   ✅ Found X patients
   ```

3. **Verify Supabase directly** (optional):
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to Table Editor → patients
   - Check the `enrollment_status` column values

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to revert the backend changes:

```bash
git diff backend/app/main.py
git checkout backend/app/main.py
```

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding an `enrollment_status` filter toggle in the UI
- Add ability to search for 'completed' or 'withdrawn' patients separately
- Add enrollment status badges in patient cards
