🎯 HAVEN HEALTH AGENT - ACTION DEMONSTRATIONS
===============================================

This agent DOES, not just chats. Here are the autonomous actions it takes:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔍 ACTION 1: DIAGNOSTIC SEARCH & ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------

USER QUERY: "patient has chest pain"

AGENT ACTIONS:
1. ✅ Searches medical knowledge base
2. ✅ Identifies possible causes (MI, angina, PE)
3. ✅ Generates differential diagnosis
4. ✅ Recommends specific tests (ECG, troponin)
5. ✅ Provides step-by-step protocol

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
```
🔍 DIAGNOSTIC SEARCH RESULTS

Symptom: chest

Possible Causes (CAR-T context):
1. cardiac event
2. myocardial infarction
3. angina
4. pulmonary embolism

📋 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
• Immediate ECG
• Check troponin levels
• Assess for cardiac toxicity
• Monitor continuously
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💊 ACTION 2: PROTOCOL RECOMMENDATION
-------------------------------------

USER QUERY: "recommend treatment protocol"

AGENT ACTIONS:
1. ✅ Analyzes all active patient alerts
2. ✅ Searches for matching protocols
3. ✅ Generates personalized treatment plan
4. ✅ Prioritizes by severity
5. ✅ Provides medication recommendations

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
```
🏥 PROTOCOL RECOMMENDATIONS:

🚨 CRITICAL PROTOCOL:
1. Activate rapid response team
2. Continuous monitoring required
3. Prepare ICU transfer
4. Notify attending physician

💊 CRS MANAGEMENT:
• Grade assessment needed
• Consider tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor)
• Supportive care (fluids, oxygen)
• Monitor for progression
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 ACTION 3: CROSS-PATIENT CORRELATION
---------------------------------------

USER QUERY: "find patterns across patients"

AGENT ACTIONS:
1. ✅ Searches all historical alerts
2. ✅ Correlates symptoms across patients
3. ✅ Identifies safety signals
4. ✅ Detects adverse event clusters
5. ✅ Recommends protocol review

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
```
🔍 PATTERN ANALYSIS ACROSS PATIENTS:

Most Common Concerns:
• fever: 5 occurrence(s)
• possible_CRS: 4 occurrence(s)
• abnormal_heart_rate: 3 occurrence(s)

⚠️ ALERT: 'fever' detected in multiple patients
Recommended: Review CAR-T protocol for common adverse events
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚨 ACTION 4: AUTONOMOUS ALERT ESCALATION
-----------------------------------------

TRIGGERED BY: Critical vitals from monitoring system

AGENT ACTIONS (AUTOMATIC):
1. ✅ Receives patient vital data
2. ✅ Analyzes severity (rule-based + Claude AI)
3. ✅ Generates structured alert
4. ✅ Broadcasts to medical staff
5. ✅ Logs for compliance
6. ✅ Tracks in alert history

EXAMPLE ALERT:
```
{
  "alert_id": "A123",
  "patient_id": "P-001",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "message": "🚨 CRITICAL: Patient P-001 requires immediate attention",
  "reasoning": "HR: 145 bpm, Temp: 39.8°C, SpO2: 88%, Distress: 9/10. 
               Concerns: severe_hypoxia, possible_CRS",
  "recommended_action": "🚨 IMMEDIATE: Call physician, activate emergency protocol"
}
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 ACTION 5: PATIENT-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT
-----------------------------------------

USER QUERY: "patient P-001 status"

AGENT ACTIONS:
1. ✅ Retrieves latest patient data
2. ✅ Searches patient alert history
3. ✅ Correlates with current symptoms
4. ✅ Generates comprehensive report
5. ✅ Recommends next steps

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
```
📋 P-001 Current Status:

Vitals:
• Heart Rate: 120 bpm
• Temperature: 38.5°C
• BP: 145/90
• SpO2: 94%

CV Metrics:
• Distress: 7/10
• Movement: 6/10

⚠️ Latest Alert: WARNING
Action: ⚠️ URGENT: Assess patient in person, increase monitoring 
        frequency, prepare for escalation
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧪 TEST QUERIES FOR ASI:ONE
============================

Try these to see the agent in action:

1. DIAGNOSTIC SEARCH:
   "@haven-health-agent patient has chest pain"
   "@haven-health-agent fever symptoms"
   "@haven-health-agent breathing issues"

2. PROTOCOL RECOMMENDATIONS:
   "@haven-health-agent recommend treatment"
   "@haven-health-agent suggest protocol"

3. PATTERN ANALYSIS:
   "@haven-health-agent find patterns"
   "@haven-health-agent correlate symptoms"

4. SYSTEM STATUS:
   "@haven-health-agent status"
   "@haven-health-agent show alerts"

5. HELP:
   "@haven-health-agent help"
   "@haven-health-agent what can you do"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏆 FETCH.AI RUBRIC ALIGNMENT
=============================

✅ UNDERSTANDS GOALS & INTENT:
   - Interprets "chest pain" → diagnostic search
   - Understands "recommend" → protocol generation
   - Recognizes "pattern" → correlation analysis

✅ MAKES DECISIONS:
   - Automatically classifies severity (CRITICAL/WARNING/NORMAL)
   - Decides which protocol to recommend
   - Prioritizes alerts by urgency

✅ TAKES ACTIONS:
   - Searches medical knowledge base
   - Generates differential diagnoses
   - Recommends specific tests and treatments
   - Correlates data across patients
   - Broadcasts alerts to staff
   - Logs for compliance

✅ NOT JUST CHAT:
   - Autonomous monitoring runs 24/7
   - Automatic escalation of critical cases
   - Protocol recommendations based on real data
   - Pattern detection without human input

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 KEY DIFFERENTIATORS
======================

THIS AGENT: Acts autonomously to save lives

MOST AGENTS: Provide general information
THIS AGENT: Specific medical protocols and actions

MOST AGENTS: Respond when asked
THIS AGENT: Monitors 24/7 and alerts proactively

MOST AGENTS: One-off interactions
THIS AGENT: Continuous learning from patient patterns
